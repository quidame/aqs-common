# AQS

This is yet another Ansible Quick Starter. This repository is intended to
provide the common documentation and centralize links to other AQS stuff.

The target is Debian.
The license is GPLv3.

This AQS would provide (this list is currently my todo list):

- [`filesystems`](https://github.com/quidame/aqs-role-filesystems):
  a role to manage local filesystems and Logical Volumes.
- [`iptables`](https://github.com/quidame/aqs-role-iptables):
  a role to manage iptables ruleset
- [`packages`](https://github.com/quidame/aqs-role-packages):
  a role to manage debian packages and their configuration (debconf)
